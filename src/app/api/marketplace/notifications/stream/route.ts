//
// GET -> one Server-Sent-Events connection for the signed-in user. This is
// the ONLY SSE endpoint in the app — src/app/studashboard/marketplace/_components/NotificationProvider.tsx
// opens exactly one EventSource to it per session and shares the result
// with every marketplace component (bell, dropdown, etc) via context.
//
// Delivery is two-layered: the in-process broadcaster
// (services/marketplace/notifications/sse-broadcaster.ts) pushes
// immediately when a notification is created on THIS server instance; a
// short interval poll (every 5s) inside this same connection also checks
// the DB directly, so a notification created by a request handled on a
// different instance still arrives within a few seconds. The database
// stays the single source of truth either way (see
// services/marketplace/notifications/notification.service.ts) — SSE only
// ever communicates that something changed.
//
// Idempotency: both paths funnel through the same send() below, which is
// the single gate that decides whether a notification actually goes out
// over the wire. It's keyed on Notification.id — not on the poll's
// createdAt cursor alone, since two notifications can share a timestamp —
// so if the broadcaster already delivered id X the instant it was
// created, the poll finding that same row moments later is a no-op, and
// vice versa. sentIds is capped so a long-lived connection doesn't grow
// this set forever.
//
// Node runtime (not edge): needs Prisma and the session helper, neither of
// which run on the edge runtime.
