// src/app/studashboard/marketplace/_components/MarketplaceComingSoon.tsx
//
// Section-scoped "not built yet" placeholder for marketplace sections
// backed by no real data source — currently Skills/Services (the Skill/
// SkillOffer models exist in prisma/schema.prisma, but there's no API
// route, service, or listing-creation flow for them anywhere in the app).
// Same visual convention as
// src/app/studashboard/admin/_components/DomainComingSoon.tsx (icon in a
// rounded box + heading + description), but with buyer-facing copy — that
// component's text ("{label} admin", "nothing to administer") is written
// for an admin audience and doesn't fit here, so this is a small sibling
// rather than a direct reuse.
