// Shared "does this business belong to this signed-in user" check, used by
// every owner-scoped controller (business profile, products, orders,
// fines) so a business's dashboard data is only ever readable/writable by
// its owner. Throws ServiceError (401/404) rather than returning a
// NextResponse — see src/lib/service-error.ts and
// src/lib/controller-helpers.ts for how controllers turn that into the
// right HTTP response.

// ownership check alone would pass (a determined vendor owner typing the
// Business API URL directly, not just following a UI link) — see
// docs/marketplace/decisions/vendor-independent-architecture.md. Not
// used by requireOwnedBusiness itself, since Vendor's own service layer
// legitimately calls that one too.
