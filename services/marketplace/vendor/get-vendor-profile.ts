// Owner-scoped full vendor profile — the vendor's OWN dashboard's Profile
// tab and its approval gate. Deliberately separate from
// get-vendor-storefront.ts (public, no auth, only approved/non-sensitive
// fields) and from Business's own get-business-detail.ts (Business-owned
// fields like deliveryDays/industry that a vendor profile doesn't use) —
// see docs/marketplace/decisions/vendor-independent-architecture.md.
// Called by src/app/api/marketplace/vendor/[id]/profile/route.controller.ts.
