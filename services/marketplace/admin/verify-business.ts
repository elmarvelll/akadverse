// services/marketplace/admin/verify-business.ts
//
// Admin approves a business's pending verification request (or verifies
// directly, if somehow called with no pending request — kept permissive
// since the Businesses tab's older one-click "Verify" button still calls
// this too). Idempotent — verifying an already-verified business is a
// no-op rather than an error, so a double-click can't corrupt state or
// write a duplicate audit entry. Called by
// src/app/api/marketplace/admin/businesses/[businessId]/verify/route.controller.ts.
