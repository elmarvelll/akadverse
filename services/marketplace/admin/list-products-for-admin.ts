// services/marketplace/admin/list-products-for-admin.ts
//
// Every product on the marketplace, for the admin Products tab
// (src/app/studashboard/admin/marketplace/products/page.tsx) — grouped by
// business, literally: pagination happens at the BUSINESS level (only
// businesses with >=1 product, ordered by name), and each page's response
// includes each of those businesses' full product list (reusing
// services/marketplace/product/list-business-products.ts as-is). This
// makes the "Business A: [...products], Business B: [...products]"
// grouping real rather than a flat list with a business column.
//
// Deliberately NOT gated on approvalStatus: "APPROVED" (unlike the
// buyer-facing services/marketplace/product/search-products.ts) — admins
// specifically need visibility into products belonging to pending/
// rejected/suspended businesses too.
//
// `q` matches either the business name (shows ALL of that business's
// products) or a product name (narrows to just the matching products
// within businesses that have one) — both are OR'd together at the
// business-selection level, then resolved per-business below. `businessId`
// jumps straight to one business's full product list (no pagination
// needed within one business, same reasoning as list-business-products.ts).
//
// Called by src/app/api/marketplace/admin/products/route.controller.ts.
