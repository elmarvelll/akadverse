// Step 1 of the Seller -> Delivery Coordinator handoff (the first of the
// three chain-of-custody handoffs — see
// docs/marketplace/systems/delivery-coordinator-system.md). The seller
// arrives at the central drop-off point with a READY_FOR_PICKUP order and
// requests the handoff; this issues a one-time OTP that only the seller
// sees. The seller reads/shows that code to the coordinator, who enters it
// server-side via confirm-seller-dropoff.ts — that second step, not this
// one, is what actually records the order as dropped off/received.
//
// Deliberately NOT a self-attested "I dropped it off" action: the package
// isn't considered to have changed hands until the coordinator verifies
// the OTP, which is why sellerDroppedOffAt is untouched here.
//
// Called by
// src/app/api/marketplace/businesses/[id]/orders/[orderId]/drop-off/route.controller.ts.
